# wroutine: Transliteration Snippets for Atom

`snippets.csv` contains a table of variables to be converted into transliteration snippets for Atom. You can edit this file and add more relevant snippets.

Run `generate_snippets.py` to convert data from `snippets.csv` into the snippets format that Atom understands. These will be saved into `paste_to_snippets.cson.txt`.

The script also generates *hijri>CE* conversion data (for years only).

## Adding snippets to Atom

1. Open `paste_to_snippets.cson.txt`, select everything and copy into buffer (Ctrl+c).
2. In Atom, open `Atom > Snippets...` (this will open `snippets.scon`)
3. At the end of the file, paste (Ctrl+v) what you copied from `paste_to_snippets.cson.txt`
4. Snippets should start working immediately.

## Current configuration

1. Type `code`, then `Tab` key to insert the desired character.
2. `Codes` are organized as follows:
	1. All start with `,` — a comma
	2. The second character is:
		1. `*`, `.`, or `8` for characters with `dots` (ḥ, ṭ, ḍ, ġ, etc.)
		2. `_`, or `-` for characters with macrons and breves (ā, ḫ, ḏ, ṯ, etc.)
		3. `^` for characters with `^` (š, ǧ, etc.)
	3. The third character is the desired letter (capitalized, if necessary.
	4. After that, press `Tab` to complete conversion.
3. **NB:** There are some additional characters:
	1. `,<` or `,'` for *hamzaŧ*
	2. `,>` or `,\`` for *ʿayn*
	3. `,=t` for *tāʾ marbūṭaŧ*
	4. `,~a` or `,\`a` for *ã*, *dagger alif*
